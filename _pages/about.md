I am a Lecturer / Assistant Professor and [ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Awardee](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/funding-schemes/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra) at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland (UQ), Australia. My research interests center on data-centric learning, aiming to leverage imperfect and inexact data to enhance model recognition in 2D/3D in open-world environments. I was honored with the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/) and [ICT Young Achiever, Women in Technology (WiT)](https://wit.org.au/awards/2018-award-winners/). I earned my PhD in Computer Science from UQ in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof Helen Huang](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/huang/) and [Dr Mahsa Baktahmotlagh](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/23393). I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2017.
